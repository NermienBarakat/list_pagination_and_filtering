# List Pagination and Filtering


## This project utilizes a progressive enhancement approach to add pagination and search filtering features to a student list page. 

You can prview [List Pagination and Filtering](https://github.com/NermienBarakat/list_pagination_and_filtering_JS).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
