This project utilizes a progressive enhancement approach to add pagination, search filtering features and random background color change to a client list page using only Vanilla JavaScript.

## Project objective
Without JavaScript, this page displays a long list of client. I have enhanced the usability of the page by using unobtrusive JavaScript to dynamically divide the list into "pages". Each 'page' now only displays 10 clients at a time.

## Features
- [x] Random background color change with page selection.
- [x]  Pagination -- Show only 10 clients/page
- [x] Added a search feature to filter/find client
- [x] Updated pagination results based on search
- [x] Created fallback message for when no search results are available
